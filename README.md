# WOM exporter addon for Blender
Export meshes directly from blender into the .wom file format used by the game Wurm Unlimited.

At a later date this addon will support exporting animations as well.

# How to install
 1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/Tyoda/wom-exporter/releases/latest), or the latest version in the repo using git.
 2. Locate your blender installation.
 3. Copy the io_scene_wom folder and its contents into your addons folder. In your installation folder you will find the folder `3.5/scripts/addons`.
 4. Launch or restart blender. Export like any other format. And use wisely!

# Which version of blender
I made the addon using blender 3.5.1. Any other versions may or may not work. I will try to ensure the latest version of blender always works.

# I have a problem!
Please open an issue here on github and explain in detail what the problem is. Provide a .blend file, if possible. I can not guarantee to respond right away.
